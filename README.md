![logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d753fbb-23f7-41fe-a94b-e5e6d90582e1) A JavaFX-based desktop application designed to interface with the Bruel & Kjaer 2306 Level Recorder. This application processes acoustic data from CSV files (ARTA and REW formats) and sends control commands to the device over a serial connection.
This useless and stupid idea allows generating report prints like in the old days. What you see in ARTA or REW will simply be printed on paper. **That's all**.

Compatible with macOS, Windows, Linux, see the release section.

### ðŸš€ Features

- Import CSV files from ARTA and REW.
- Display a plot of frequency vs. amplitude.
- Downsampling and smoothing for better readability.
- Automatic calculation of min/max frequencies and amplitude.
- Real-time control of the paper speed.
- Serial communication with the B&K 2306 over Arduino.

## ðŸ”Œ Interface Overview

To interface with the Bruel & Kjaer 2306, I created a DAC interface using an Arduino.

#### Operation Principle

The software sends serial commands to the Arduino, which uses a 16-bit DAC to convert the digital signal into an analog output within a 0-5V range.  
The Arduino manages the paper feed motor's activation and speed.

A relay closes a connection to start the paper feed motor, while the speed is regulated by a TTL signal.
